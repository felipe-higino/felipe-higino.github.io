Why you should use `Assembly Definitions` in your next Unity project? And why you shouldn't? 

For the ones who don't have enough time to read (sadly üôÅ), here is the key answers:

## TL;DR

### Why
- guarantees project features granularity
- better dependency management (better code architecture)
- better testability (unit tests / `test framework` integration)
- reduce compile times (exponentially increases iteration times)

### Why not
- overusing can increase runtime memory usage
- team members familiarity
    - can cause merge conflicts
    - not undestanding how dll dependencies works
